                standard.

                For a while, I thought my love affair with design would be all
                about colors, grids, and convincing clients that white space
                isnt actually wasted space. But somewhere between shipping my
                fifth design system and dodging endless handoff meetings,
                <span className="bg-yellow-100 font-semibold px-1 rounded">
                  I realized something crucial: real magic happens when you
                  understand both how things look and how they work under the
                  hood.

                No more just passing pretty Figma files to developers and hoping

                turned into living, breathing products.

                In my free time, you will still find me sketching new concepts,
                experimenting with open-source projects, or just giving random
                side projects the kind of pixel-perfect attention that would
                make myself proud. It reminds me why I started this journey in
                the first place: to create things that are both beautiful and
                meaningful.
