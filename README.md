My Dev Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to My Dev Portfolio – a Next.js-powered showcase of my coding adventures, creative experiments, and the occasional typo fix (because perfection is overrated, right?).

✨ Features
	•	Built with Next.js: Lightning-fast, SEO-friendly, and developer-approved.
	•	TypeScript All the Way: Because type safety is just as important as helmet safety.
	•	Tailwind CSS Styling: For those who like their UIs sharp and their classes even sharper.
	•	Reactive Header Experiments: The header reacts faster than you do when you spill coffee on your keyboard.
	•	Live Deployments via Vercel: See changes in real time at my portfolio site ↗.
